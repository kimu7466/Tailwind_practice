Q : when to use apply directive and layer directive?

ans: 

only for those classes that you are gonna use repeatedly.
specially for something special classes that are unique for your project 
otherwise use classes only in HTML no matter how much messed up it looks like
but this is the best way to use tailwind css    


if we use apply directive unnecessarily that will require the efforts of a traditional workflow
so do not shift maintainability in the css file unnecessarily
