we are already using vite

so we can use vite build for production. 
note :- google it for more info "vite build for production"
or go to this link "https://vitejs.dev/guide/build"

add the script given below in package.json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build"
  },

make sure to give proper url using / of your stylesheets
for examples :-     / before style.css

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
                                ||
                                \/
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">

note :- if any error comes up add of remove first / of the path it works for now :-{
  Refused to apply style from 'http://127.0.0.1:5500/assets/index-uwX8pBEf.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.

  i encountered the error above strict MIME checking related but removing / resolved my problem
}

then run the command 
npm run build 
this will create a folder named "dist" with ready to deploy html and required assets

if you want to change anything you need to run "npm run build" command again.
